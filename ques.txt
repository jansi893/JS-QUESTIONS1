1.⁠ ⁠Basic Console Usage
	1.	Write a program that calculates the sum of 5 + 10, assigns it to a variable, and logs the result to the console.
 
 answer => var a = 20;
var b = 30;
var c = a + b;
console.log(c);

2.⁠ ⁠Variables and Data Types
	2.	Declare a variable age with the value 25. Then, reassign it to 30 and log its type using typeof.

answer=> var age = 25;
age = 30;
console.log(age);
console.log(typeof(age));

3.⁠ ⁠Loops
	3.	Write a for loop that prints all the odd numbers between 1 and 20.

	answer=> for(var i = 1; i <= 20; i++){
    if(i % 2 === 1){
        console.log(i);
    }
}        
	4.	Create a while loop that starts at 10 and decreases by 2 until it reaches 0. Log each step.

	answer=>var i = 10;
while(i>=0){
    console.log(i);
    i-=2
}

4.⁠ ⁠Arrays
	5.	Create an array of your favorite fruits (at least 5).
	•	Add a new fruit to the end of the array.
	•	Remove the first fruit from the array.
	•	Log the updated array.

answer=> var arr = ['apple', 'banana','cherry',' grapes','mango'];
arr.push('apple');
arr.shift('apple');
console.log(arr);

	6.	Write a program that iterates over an array of numbers and prints only the numbers greater than 10.

	answer=>
	var arr = [0,1,11,2,22,3,33,4,44,5,55,6,66,7,77,8,88,9,99,100];
      var i = 0;
      while(i<arr.length){
if (arr[i]> 10){
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
i++
      } 

5.⁠ ⁠Functions
	7.	Write a function multiplyNumbers that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product. Test the function with values 5 and 6.

answer=>	function abcd(a,b){
    return a*b
}
console.log(abcd(5,6)) ;
 

6.⁠ ⁠Conditionals
	8.	Write an if...else statement to check if a number is divisible by 3. If it is, log “Divisible by 3,” otherwise log “Not divisible by 3.”

answer=>var i = 30;
if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Divisible by 3");
}
else{
    console.log(" Not Divisible by 3");
}
 

7.⁠ ⁠Object Basics
	9.	Create an object book with properties: title, author, and year. Add a new property genre with the value fiction and log the updated object.
	answer=>var book={
    title: "The class",
    author: "jansi",
    year: 2004

};
book.genre = "fiction";
console.log(book);

8.⁠ ⁠String Manipulation
	10.	Write a program that takes a string JavaScript is fun! and:
	•	Converts it to all uppercase.
	•	Extracts the first 10 characters.
	•	Replaces the word fun with awesome.

	answer=>var js = 'JavaScript is fun';
console.log(js.slice(0,11));
console.log(js.replace('fun', 'awesome'));
console.log(js.toUpperCase());
